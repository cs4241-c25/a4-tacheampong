## GiftTopia

- The goal of this application is to fulfill purchases for users through the site GiftTopia. From
assignment 3 I have modified the structure of the application to use component based design with Nextjs.
I used nextjs's app structure to create designated pages for the home, shop, and login page which differed
from a3. I also created a layout designated for global style and content that would appear for all pages
In a3 I had a single page for my application and modified the display options when applicable. In this
application I removed the latter functionality. I used nextjs's server to make requests to the database using
actions whenever a user needs to sign in, purchase, edit, or delete. I also made a point to add an indication
that the page is loading with text sent to the screen to let the user know about the status of the page.
- I utilized Next.js'S authentication NextAuth for authentication.
- Through a3 and a4 I've maintained a similar style
